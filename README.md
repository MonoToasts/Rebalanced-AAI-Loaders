## Settings

- Recipe Multiplier: Sets the recipe cost multiplier. For example, a value of 10 makes recipes cost roughly as much as two splitters of the same belt tier. 
- Power Cost: Defines energy usage in Joules per item processed, with idle energy drain at half the belt speed in Watts. Set to 0 to disable power cost.
